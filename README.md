## Objective
To develop hands-on expertise in Windows penetration testing, focusing on key attack vectors such as LLMNR poisoning, SMB relay attacks, IPv6 exploitation, Pass The Hash, and Kerberoasting. The goal is to understand and apply practical techniques for identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities in Windows environments, ultimately enhancing the ability to secure and defend corporate networks.

### Skills Learned
- LLMNR Poisoning
  - Understanding of network name resolution protocols (LLMNR and NetBIOS).
  - Ability to perform poisoning attacks to intercept and redirect traffic for credential capture.
  - Recognizing misconfigurations in network settings that enable this vulnerability.
- SMB Relay Attacks
  - Expertise in exploiting SMB protocols to relay authentication requests and bypass security measures.
  - Ability to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to access systems without requiring plaintext passwords.
  - Practical application of techniques to escalate privileges in Windows environments.
- IPv6 Attacks
  - Understanding IPv6-specific attack vectors and potential security risks in hybrid IPv4/IPv6 networks.
  - Ability to disable or exploit IPv6 misconfigurations to bypass firewalls and network segmentation controls.
  - Hands-on experience with exploiting IPv6-related vulnerabilities in Windows environments.
- Pass The Hash (PTH) and Password Attacks
  - Mastery of attacking Windows authentication protocols by using cached credentials or hash values.
  - Practical knowledge of lateral movement techniques, such as using PTH to escalate privileges without needing the plaintext password.
  - Skills in evading detection and maintaining access in compromised environments.
- Kerberoasting
  - Proficiency in exploiting service account misconfigurations in Active Directory.
  - Ability to request service tickets and perform offline cracking to recover service account passwords.
  - In-depth knowledge of how to leverage Kerberos authentication weaknesses for privilege escalation.

### Tools Used
- Kali Linux: Penetration testing tool to perform attacks on a vulnerable machine.
- Windows Server 2022 Eval: Act as an Active Directory service.
- Windows 10 Eval: End-user workstation.
- VMWare Workstation: Isolated environment for testing and simulation.
